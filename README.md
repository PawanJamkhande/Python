# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that implement fundamental data structures and algorithms. It is designed as a reference and educational resource for anyone who wants to understand, learn, or practice essential programming concepts in Python.

## Contents

The following are the main scripts and what they cover:

- **graph.py**  
  Implementation and algorithms related to graphs, including representations and traversals.

- **linked_list1.py**  
  Code for creating and manipulating singly or doubly linked lists.

- **list_handling.py**  
  Various list operations including searching, sorting, and other manipulations.

- **queue1.py**  
  Implementation of the queue data structure and related operations.

- **stack.py**  
  Code for stack data structure and its operations, such as push and pop.

- **toh.py**  
  Likely implements the classic Tower of Hanoi recursive algorithm.

- **test.py**  
  Testing or demonstration file (could contain sample usage or tests for the above modules).

## Why This Repository?

The goal of this repository is to provide clean, simple, and understandable implementations of core computer science concepts. Whether you are:

- Preparing for coding interviews
- Revising for data structures and algorithms exams
- Learning Python as a beginner or intermediate developer
- Interested in how basic programming problems are solved in Python

This repo aims to be a handy resource and learning companion.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PawanJamkhande/Python.git
    ```

2. **Explore individual scripts:**
   Each `.py` file can be run independently. For example:
    ```bash
    python graph.py
    ```

3. **Modify or extend code:**
   Feel free to tweak, test, or expand upon the existing implementations.
